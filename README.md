# Chapter 2 Lab - Task 2: Encoding

In the previous task (Task 1), We have been sending the password in clear text. In this task, you will get a demonstration of how to encode/decode the password using base64 encoding format.

## Project Preparation

1. Clone or download the code from the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/houcine1amraoui/lab2-task2-encoding-demo
2. Open the project folder with VS Code.
3. Open the integrated terminal, “cd” into the “server” folder, then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the server.
4. Open the integrated terminal, “cd” into the “client” folder, then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the client.
5. Run the server.

## Questions

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and decode the exchanged traffic between the client and the server.
2. What do you conclude?
3. Exploit the vulnerability of sending the password encoded to alter the password.
